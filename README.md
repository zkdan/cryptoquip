# Cryptoquotes
An NYT-inspired word game that allows players to solve a monoalphabetic substitution cypher to reveal a quote from the <a href="https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable#quotable">Quotable API</a>.

## To do
- localStorage/cookies for one quip a day per user
- Error handling (same letter chosen)
- Alert for win
- Add author of quote
- Click off to deselect quip letter
- Hint
- Figure out why the first letter is buggy
- ~~Display paired letter above quip letter~~
- ~~Toggle pairing of alphabet letter when tapped~~
- ~~Line breaks at spaces, not inside words~~
- ~~useReducer to coordinate letters chosen~~
